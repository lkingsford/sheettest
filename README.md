... Still figuring out what this is going to be. Do not even **think** about
using any of this in production, if you know what's a good idea. It is an
experiment that may go somewhere, or may never get another commit beyond the
incomplete set of unit tests that just got added.

# Questions:

### Why are you using `eval`/`exec` - isn't that blatantly unsafe?

Yes, it is. This is still an experiment.

### What are you trying to do?

My head is thinking about data, tables and spreadsheets - and I want to see if
I can come up with some tooling in a language I like, that deals with the
things I hate about using Excel

### Those test cases don't look very thorough...

... they're experiments to see if I like the way it's working.

### You're being very defensive

Yeah. I just want to be clarifying that my standards of code are different
between a personal experimental project and something I'm doing in a
professional, production setting. I just prefer to do this in public spaces
sometimes rather than keeping it private until it's ready.
