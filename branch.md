Leaving this work in a branch, so I can back it up to github while I'm doing it. 

I haven't designed what I want this to look like (if it gets much attention at all) - but I'm semi-designing its interface by writing unit tests (which still may change). Think of it as experimental TDD without the planning. Which is acceptable if you're doing something for its own sake.
